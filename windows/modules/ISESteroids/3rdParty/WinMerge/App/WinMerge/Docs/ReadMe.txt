WINMERGE

WinMerge is an Open Source comparing and merging tool for Windows. WinMerge can
compare both folders and files, presenting differences in a visual text format
that is easy to understand and handle. WinMerge can be used as an external
differencing/merging tool or as a standalone application.

WinMerge has many helpful supporting features to make comparing, synchronising,
and merging as easy and useful as possible. Several programming languages and
other file formats are syntax-highlighted.

The latest WinMerge version and WinMerge information is available at
http://winmerge.org/.

Quick start
===========
To learn how to perform basic operations after installing WinMerge, click
Help>WinMerge Help and navigate to the Quick start topic.  Or, go to the Web
version at http://manual.winmerge.org/QuickStart.html.

WinMerge Help
============= 
WinMerge Help is installed locally as a Microsoft HTML Help file, WinMerge.chm,
when you install WinMerge. To open Help, click Help>WinMerge Help or press F1 in
the WinMerge window. On the command line, run the WinMerge executable with the 
/? help switch.

You can also browse the HTML version of WinMerge Help at 
http://manual.winmerge.org/.

Archive Support
===============
WinMerge uses the 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org) Open Source archive tool for
archive file support. We recommended installing the 7-Zip application by
downloading and running the 7-Zip plugin installer from 
http://winmerge.org/downloads/.

If you cannot install the 7-Zip tool for any reason, you can use the 7-zip
plugin installer to install only the files required for archive file
support. See the Help topic, "7-Zip and archive support" for details.

WinMerge Support
================
Questions or suggestions about WinMerge? A good place to start is the WinMerge
community bulletin board at http://forums.winmerge.org/. Developers frequently
read and respond to questions in both forums. Use the Open Discussion forum for
general WinMerge issues, such as questions about usage. Use the Developers forum
for WinMerge development issues.

Bugs and feature requests
=========================
If an issue is not resolved in the the WinMerge forums, check the project
trackers: go to http://project.winmerge.org/, and click a link in the Trackers
menu, like Bugs and Feature Requests, where you can browse or submit items.

If you submit a bug, please include the WinMerge version number in your
report. You can generate a configuration log by clicking Help>Configuration.
Please attach the configuration log to the bug report; it has lots of useful
information for developers.
